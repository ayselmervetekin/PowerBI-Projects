**Project Overview:** I built a Marketing Campaign Analysis dashboard in Power BI to evaluate campaign effectiveness across customer demographics and regions. The dashboard provided key insights into customer response rates, income levels, and engagement across multiple countries.

**Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Using Power Query Editor, I cleaned the dataset by fixing missing values and standardizing columns like country, education, and marital status. This ensured accuracy in reporting and analysis.

**Key Metrics & Visuals:**

*Customer Responses by Country:* A clustered column chart highlighted the number of accepted responses from countries like the USA, Germany, and India, identifying high- and low-performing regions.

*Income and Demographic Analysis:* A line chart displayed the average income of respondents ($52.25K), segmented by education level (e.g., PhD, Masterâ€™s) and marital status. Higher education was linked to higher income, providing a clear customer profile.

*Campaign Response Rates:* A stacked bar chart showed campaign performance, with Campaign 1 achieving a 33.37% acceptance rate, helping the team identify the most effective campaign.

*Demographic Segmentation:* A pie chart visualized the distribution of customer responses by marital status, where married individuals had the highest engagement.

**Slicers and Interactivity:** I added slicers for dynamic filtering by country, education, and marital status, enabling targeted analysis of specific customer segments.

**Data Modeling:** The model used 1-to-many relationships to connect customer demographics and campaign responses, ensuring accurate data integration and reporting.
