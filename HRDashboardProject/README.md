![HR_Dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/933ed093-3e43-4437-ac11-64943b320c60) 

**Project Overview:** I developed an interactive HR dashboard using Power BI to provide insights into workforce composition, salary structures, and leave balances. The dashboard enables real-time monitoring of metrics such as headcount, gender distribution, salary breakdown, and employee age.

**Data Preparation:** I used Power Query Editor for data cleaning, ensuring consistency across job titles, salaries, and qualifications. This included handling missing data and formatting numeric fields for accurate calculations.

**Key Metrics & Visuals:**

*Headcount by Job Title:* A clustered bar chart shows staff distribution across roles (e.g., Packaging Associate with 22 employees). This assists in workforce allocation and planning.

*Gender Distribution:* A pie chart reveals the gender split (54.66% female, 45.34% male), supporting diversity initiatives.

*Age Distribution:* A histogram presents employee age ranges, helping identify age demographics for targeted programs.

*Salary Analysis:* A scatter chart breaks down salaries by qualifications (Bachelorâ€™s, Diploma, etc.).

*Cumulative Headcount Growth:* A line chart tracks staff growth from 2018 to 2023, highlighting recruitment trends.

*Leave Balance:* A bar chart displays average leave balances across departments and highlights employees with over 20 days of leave.

*Interactivity & Data Model:* I integrated slicers for dynamic filtering by job title, gender, and join date, enhancing usability. The underlying data model used 1-to-many relationships for accurate aggregation between employee and job/salary data.
