You can access my Power BI projects. 
## HR Dashboard Project 
**Project Overview:** I developed an interactive HR dashboard using Power BI to provide insights into workforce composition, salary structures, and leave balances. The dashboard enables real-time monitoring of metrics such as headcount, gender distribution, salary breakdown, and employee age.

**Data Preparation:** I used Power Query Editor for data cleaning, ensuring consistency across job titles, salaries, and qualifications. This included handling missing data and formatting numeric fields for accurate calculations.

**Key Metrics & Visuals:**

*Headcount by Job Title:* A clustered bar chart shows staff distribution across roles (e.g., Packaging Associate with 22 employees). This assists in workforce allocation and planning.

*Gender Distribution:* A pie chart reveals the gender split (54.66% female, 45.34% male), supporting diversity initiatives.

*Age Distribution:* A histogram presents employee age ranges, helping identify age demographics for targeted programs.

*Salary Analysis:* A scatter chart breaks down salaries by qualifications (Bachelor’s, Diploma, etc.).

*Cumulative Headcount Growth:* A line chart tracks staff growth from 2018 to 2023, highlighting recruitment trends.

*Leave Balance:* A bar chart displays average leave balances across departments and highlights employees with over 20 days of leave.

*Interactivity & Data Model:* I integrated slicers for dynamic filtering by job title, gender, and join date, enhancing usability. The underlying data model used 1-to-many relationships for accurate aggregation between employee and job/salary data.

## Marketing Campaign Analysis 1
**Project Overview:** I built a Marketing Campaign Analysis dashboard in Power BI to evaluate campaign effectiveness across customer demographics and regions. The dashboard provided key insights into customer response rates, income levels, and engagement across multiple countries.

**Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Using Power Query Editor, I cleaned the dataset by fixing missing values and standardizing columns like country, education, and marital status. This ensured accuracy in reporting and analysis.

**Key Metrics & Visuals:**

*Customer Responses by Country:* A clustered column chart highlighted the number of accepted responses from countries like the USA, Germany, and India, identifying high- and low-performing regions.

*Income and Demographic Analysis:* A line chart displayed the average income of respondents ($52.25K), segmented by education level (e.g., PhD, Master’s) and marital status. Higher education was linked to higher income, providing a clear customer profile.

*Campaign Response Rates:* A stacked bar chart showed campaign performance, with Campaign 1 achieving a 33.37% acceptance rate, helping the team identify the most effective campaign.

*Demographic Segmentation:* A pie chart visualized the distribution of customer responses by marital status, where married individuals had the highest engagement.

**Slicers and Interactivity:** I added slicers for dynamic filtering by country, education, and marital status, enabling targeted analysis of specific customer segments.

**Data Modeling:** The model used 1-to-many relationships to connect customer demographics and campaign responses, ensuring accurate data integration and reporting.

## Marketing Campaign Analysis 2
**Project Overview:** I developed a Marketing Campaign  Analysis dashboard in Power BI to track the performance of campaigns and analyze customer purchase behavior. The dashboard provided insights into campaign effectiveness, product purchases across different channels, spending patterns, and customer complaints, enabling the marketing team to optimize future strategies.

**Data Preparation:** Using Power Query Editor, I cleaned the raw data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing column names (e.g., campaign IDs, product channels). I transformed the data into a structure suitable for data modeling and visualization.

**Key Metrics & Visuals:**

*Accepted Campaigns:* I created a stacked bar chart showing the number of accepted responses across different campaigns. For instance, Campaign 1 had a 25.04% acceptance rate, while others ranged between 21% to 24%, providing a clear comparison of campaign performance.

*Product Purchases by Channel:* A clustered column chart visualized product purchases across four channels: Catalog, Web, Deals, and Store. Store purchases led with 38.96%, while Web purchases accounted for 27.48%. This helped identify the most effective sales channels for future campaign targeting.

*Income vs. Spending Correlation:* I used a scatter plot to reveal a positive correlation between income and spending, where customers with higher incomes tend to spend more. This insight supported targeted marketing for high-income customers, driving more personalized campaign strategies.

*Spending Patterns (Yearly & Quarterly):* A line chart was used to display income and spending trends on a quarterly and yearly basis from 2012 to 2014. This visual helped the team identify seasonal peaks in customer spending, with notable increases in Q3 and Q4.

*Customer Complaints Analysis:* I visualized customer complaints over time using a line chart, tracking quarterly data. This helped identify periods where complaints spiked, assisting the customer service team in addressing issues promptly.

**Slicers and Interactivity:** To enable dynamic data exploration, I added slicers for filtering by campaign, channel, and date. This allowed users to drill down into specific metrics, such as analyzing spending patterns for a particular quarter or comparing purchases between different channels.

**Data Model & Relationships:** I built a data model with 1-to-many relationships, linking tables for campaigns, purchases, and customer demographics. This structure enabled accurate data aggregation and seamless interaction between different data points.
