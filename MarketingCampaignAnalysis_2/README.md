## Marketing Campaign Analysis 2
**Project Overview:** I developed a Marketing Campaign  Analysis dashboard in Power BI to track the performance of campaigns and analyze customer purchase behavior. The dashboard provided insights into campaign effectiveness, product purchases across different channels, spending patterns, and customer complaints, enabling the marketing team to optimize future strategies.

**Data Preparation:** Using Power Query Editor, I cleaned the raw data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing column names (e.g., campaign IDs, and product channels). I transformed the data into a structure suitable for data modeling and visualization.

**Key Metrics & Visuals:**

*Accepted Campaigns:* I created a stacked bar chart showing the number of accepted responses across different campaigns. For instance, Campaign 1 had a 25.04% acceptance rate, while others ranged between 21% to 24%, providing a clear comparison of campaign performance.

*Product Purchases by Channel:* A clustered column chart visualized product purchases across four channels: Catalog, Web, Deals, and Store. Store purchases led with 38.96%, while Web purchases accounted for 27.48%. This helped identify the most effective sales channels for future campaign targeting.

*Income vs. Spending Correlation:* I used a scatter plot to reveal a positive correlation between income and spending, where customers with higher incomes tend to spend more. This insight supported targeted marketing for high-income customers, driving more personalized campaign strategies.

*Spending Patterns (Yearly & Quarterly):* A line chart was used to display income and spending trends on a quarterly and yearly basis from 2012 to 2014. This visual helped the team identify seasonal peaks in customer spending, with notable increases in Q3 and Q4.

*Customer Complaints Analysis:* I visualized customer complaints over time using a line chart, tracking quarterly data. This helped identify periods where complaints spiked, assisting the customer service team in addressing issues promptly.

**Slicers and Interactivity:** To enable dynamic data exploration, I added slicers for filtering by campaign, channel, and date. This allowed users to drill down into specific metrics, such as analyzing spending patterns for a particular quarter or comparing purchases between different channels.

**Data Model & Relationships:** I built a data model with 1-to-many relationships, linking tables for campaigns, purchases, and customer demographics. This structure enabled accurate data aggregation and seamless interaction between different data points.
